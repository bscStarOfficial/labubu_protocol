# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js

# referral
npx hardhat verify --network bsc --constructor-args arg.js 0x7d9eBf6101e67c135d2ecA2f9DF6c8c11E6faF12
```
